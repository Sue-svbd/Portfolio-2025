          I'm a front end developer who discovered the beauty of UX design and
          decided to fill the gap between the two. I currently work remotely for
          Binkies 3D on different projects.

            <p>
              Although I still have to figure out my role in the universe and my
              divine (?) mission, I definitely have an idea about who I am in my
              daily life.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm Susanna, I'm Italian and I don't like tomatoes. I like to
              think of myself as a curious and creative person. I like to
              constantly learn, and if I'm passionate about something, I'll go
              ballistic about it.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have different passions. First and foremost,
              <span class="accent">music:</span> I like to make beats on
              Ableton, I scratch (that weird sound that you might or might not
              have heard in some hip hop tracks), I used to DJ, collect vinyl
              and I'm always scavenging to find the perfect sample.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="accent">Sports:</span> Yelling "mamma mia!" doesn't
              always take the stress away, sometimes I need a better outlet, and
              that's why most of the time you can find me boxing or just simply
              working out at the gym.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="accent">Stand-up comedy</span>: I literally listen to
              Bill Burr's podcast every day.
