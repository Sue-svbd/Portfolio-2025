              I start by digging deep to figure out the real problem. I do user
              research and use tools like Hotjar to see exactly how people are
              behaving, which gives me concrete data on their frustrations and
              where we can improve.

              Once I have a solid grasp on the problem, I start mapping out the
              solution. I begin with simple wireframes and user flows to figure
              out the most straightforward path for a person to take. At this
              early stage, it's all about getting the core experience right—the
              visual design can wait.

              Next, I turn those sketches into interactive prototypes. Because I
              can code, I often build these as high-fidelity mockups or even
              small, functional websites. This gives the team and our test users
              something realistic to click through, which leads to much better
              feedback. We’ll discuss, test, and refine the flow together until
              it feels completely intuitive.

              With the user experience locked in, I focus on designing the
              final, polished UI. My goal is always to create a look that's
              clean, elegant, and feels human. From there, I work with the
              developers to make sure the final product is built exactly as
              designed. The work doesn't stop at launch, though as I'm always
              watching user feedback and performance data to figure out what we
              can improve in the next cycle.

        <p class="philosophy-text">
          I believe the best products are born from a blend of sharp logic and
          creative intuition. My process starts by digging deep into the system,
          the users, and what they need to accomplish. I map out the
          complexities to build a logical foundation, and from that structure, I
          explore creative solutions that feel simple, elegant, and helpful. At
          the end of the day, my job is to turn complexity into clarity, and
          data into an experience that people genuinely enjoy using.
